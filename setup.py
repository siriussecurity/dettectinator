Dettectinator - The Python library to your [DeTT&amp;CT](https://github.com/rabobank-cdc/DeTTECT) YAML files.

Dettectinator is built to be included in your SOC automation tooling. It can be included as a Python library or it can be used via the command line.

Dettectinator provides plugins to read detections from your SIEM or EDR and create/update the DeTT&CT YAML file, so that you can use it to visualize your ATT&CK detection coverage in the ATT&CK Navigator.

Currently de CLI is limited to processing detections through these plugins, the library can also be used for processing data sources.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/siriussecurity/dettectinator) for more information on how to use it."""
